<h1>Editing Kompozer Forms<br>

</h1>

<form action="dumpcgi.cgi" method="get" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">If </span>you using a web browser and viewing this page from a server (on localhost or a remote server, but <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
just as a file), then you can play with the form fields, click the
submit button, and see a representation of the data sent from the form
to the CGI script. &nbsp;Back up to this page again and try some
different combinations.... &nbsp; You can also read the further text of
this page, but that is more usefully done inside of Kompozer, when you
can test out the editing features.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">If </span>you
are looking at this page in Kompozer, you should see a dotted blue
rectangle starting above the previous paragraph. &nbsp;That delimits a <span style="font-style: italic;">form</span>. &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Fields</span> of various types can be used inside a form. &nbsp;The most common types of
fields for a form are shown below. &nbsp;All fields have a <span style="font-style: italic;">name</span> and a <span style="font-style: italic;">value</span>.
&nbsp;The only values that are directly editable and visible to the
final user in a browser are the values in text fields (the most common
type of field). &nbsp;The names are not visible in the browser, but are
important when data is transmitted to a CGI script. &nbsp;In Kompozer
the names of fields are visible&nbsp;in the source view and&nbsp;in popup editing wigits (as discussed below).</p><p>To insert a whole form initially, click on the Form Icon. &nbsp;Be sure to fill in the
Action URL (the cgi script to be called).</p>
  <p>To insert and format static text (like labels) within a form, do it just as outside a
form, as in a normal word-processor.</p>

  <p>To insert a new form <span style="font-style: italic;">field</span>,
put the cursor in the proper place <span style="font-style: italic;">inside</span> your form (inside the dotted blue rectangle), then click on the little down arrow to the right of the Form icon, and
select Form Field... and then the particular kind of field you want.
&nbsp;Be
sure you insert your fields inside an existing form! &nbsp;It is a
Kompozer bug (or very poor feature!) that you can insert a field
outside of a form or where there is no form at all - do not do it,
since nothing from that firld will be transmitted to your CGI script.</p><p>My version of Komposer is inconsistent in how you select an existing field to edit and
open an editing window. &nbsp;(Komposer is&nbsp; free!) &nbsp;Methods
are indicated for each type below. &nbsp;</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Text
fields</span>:&nbsp;You <span style="font-style: italic;">cannot</span>
change the text <span style="font-style: italic;">in</span>
the box from the main Komposer editing window! &nbsp;You must open an
edit windows to change the initial value and the other attributes.
&nbsp;Two special attributes for text fields are the
  <span style="font-style: italic;">size </span>attribute
(length of the box),
and the attribute for the maximum length of the text.
&nbsp; You can open an edit window by double clicking on the text
field (plus many other ways).</p>

Your Name:<input maxlength="60" size="30" value="Who are you?" name="yourName"> <br>

  <br>

Address :<input name="addr1" value="Text longer than its box!" maxlength="60" size="16"><br>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Radio Buttons</span>: &nbsp;In a browser, only the <span style="font-style: italic;">latest</span>
clicked radio button is selected among all radio buttons with the
same <span style="font-style: italic;">name </span>attribute.
&nbsp;In the form field editing window, you can choose which
is initially selected. &nbsp;The value for each radio button must
be specified. &nbsp;Technically a radio button value has nothing to
do with any label you put in the visible page text beside the button,
but for simplicity you are likely to want the labels to&nbsp;match
the values!&nbsp; To open an edit window in my instalation of Komposer,
I need to left (normal) click on the desired button to select it, and
then I must go to the Format menu and select &nbsp;Form Field Properties...&nbsp;</p>

Color&nbsp;:<br>

Red:<input value="red" name="color" type="radio"><br>

Blue:<input value="blue" name="color" type="radio"><br>

Green:<input value="green" checked="checked" name="color" type="radio"><br>


  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check boxes</span>: &nbsp;Check&nbsp;boxes are handy when you want any number of simultaneous
check allowed (unlike radio buttons). &nbsp;If you want to deal
with each check box separately, you can give them all different names.
&nbsp;If you want to deal with all the checked boxes as a list of
values that have been checked, give them all the same name. &nbsp;(Recall this name is not visible in the normal view.)</p>
  <p>In the example below,&nbsp;the
common <span style="font-style: italic;">name </span>is
vain. &nbsp;Just to illustrate that the values for the boxes do not
need to match the labels beside them, I chose&nbsp;
values&nbsp;v1, v2, and v3 for the three boxes. &nbsp;You can
select
which ones are initially checked in the form field editing window:
&nbsp;Open an edit window the same way as with a radio button:
&nbsp;left click on the field, and go to the Format Menu and
select&nbsp;Form Field Properties...</p>


Attractive:<input value="v1" checked="checked" name="vanity" type="checkbox"><br>

Rich:<input value="v2" checked="checked" name="vanity" type="checkbox"><br>

Famous:<input value="v3" checked="checked" name="vanity" type="checkbox"><br>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Submit button</span>:
&nbsp;You must make sure you have at least one Submit Button, or you
cannot
finish and send anything to your Python script!&nbsp; If you create one
from scratch rather than editing an existing form, be sure to select
the form field type "Submit Button", not just "Button". &nbsp;Changing
the
Submit
button's <span style="font-style: italic;">value</span>
attribute changes the <span style="font-style: italic;">label</span>
that appears on the button.&nbsp; Perversely, to edit an existing Submit Button's
name (the label), you need to <span style="font-style: italic;">right</span>
click on it, not left click. &nbsp;Then in the popup menu, select
&nbsp;Form Field Properties ... </p>

  <p>&nbsp;The script called when the submit button is pressed is a
property of the <span style="font-style: italic;">whole</span>
form (the action URL). &nbsp;Hence editing the Submit button will
not change the action! &nbsp;To change the associated action URL,
&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">right</span>
click within the form but <span style="font-style: italic;">not
on any field</span>, and in the popup menu select Form
Properties.... &nbsp; Set the Action URL, but a form name is not
necessary. &nbsp;The action URL for this form is dumpcgi.cgi, which just dumps all form data to a web page.</p>


&nbsp; <input value="Submit" type="submit">
&nbsp;<br>

  <p>A reset
button is
optional.&nbsp; It tosses out all changes made by the user and
reverts
to the starting values for all fields.</p>

&nbsp; <input type="reset">
  <br>

  <p>A
<span style="font-weight: bold;">hidden field</span> returns a specified value, but is neither seen nor
editable by the browser user. &nbsp;There is a hidden field at the
bottom of this form. &nbsp;Komposer shows it as a yellow rectangle
saying 'INPUT'. &nbsp;You can double-click on it to edit it. <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; </span>Since
the position of hidden fields is not shown to the browser user, I
suggest you put them either at the beginning or the end of your forms
if you need them.</p><h3>Creating your own</h3>If you want to create your own page with a form, here are two basic approaches:<br><ul><li>Save
this form to the file name you want and eliminate the parts of the form
you do not
want, and move around and make sufficient copies of the elements you do
want. &nbsp;This provides
you with a form and a submit button in particular. &nbsp;You still need
to edit the field attributes to have the names and values you want,
particularly for the form action. &nbsp;This may be most easily done in
the source view.</li><li>Alternately,
start with a blank page. &nbsp;In this case be sure to start by
inserting a whole form! &nbsp;Click on the Form Icon. &nbsp;Be sure to
fill in the
Action URL (the cgi script to be called). &nbsp;Be careful! &nbsp;It is
a Kompozer bug that you can insert a form field where there is not
form. &nbsp;Then the page will not work!</li></ul><input name="myHiddenField" value="fromWebPage" type="hidden">
